# Why We Ditched raw-loader for MDX

When we first started working with MDX, we thought using `raw-loader` would be the easiest way to import our markdown files. Turns out, we were very wrong.

## The Problem with raw-loader

Using `raw-loader` seemed simple—until we realized:
- It was **deprecated** in modern Webpack configurations.
- It could introduce **security vulnerabilities** when not handled properly.
- It wasn’t necessary when **next-mdx-remote** existed.

## The Alternative: next-mdx-remote

Switching to `next-mdx-remote` gave us:
- Better **performance** with static generation.
- A safer, more **maintainable** approach.
- Full **MDX component support**.

Lesson learned: Just because something works doesn’t mean it’s the right tool for the job.
