# The Magic of mdx-components

One of the biggest surprises we encountered was how important **mdx-components** placement is.

## Where Not to Put It

At first, we placed it in `app/components/`—big mistake. Then we tried `lib/`. Nope. Finally, we discovered…

## The Correct Location

Your `mdx-components` file should be **at the root** of your project. Otherwise, your custom React components won’t render properly inside your MDX files.

## Lesson Learned

Read the documentation carefully, but also experiment. Sometimes, the best way to learn is by breaking things first.
