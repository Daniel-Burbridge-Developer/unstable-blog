# Debugging Webpack Errors in MDX

Our first encounter with Webpack and MDX wasâ€¦ eventful. Here are the biggest headaches and how we solved them:

## 1. The Mysterious `Module Not Found` Error

**Fix:** Ensure all dependencies (`next-mdx-remote`, `remark-*`) are installed correctly.

## 2. Webpack Dev Server Randomly Restarting

**Fix:** Check for rogue `import` statements inside Markdown files.

## 3. Unexpected Token `<`

**Fix:** Ensure your MDX files are **not** being parsed as raw JavaScript.

Webpack is tricky, but patience (and a good search engine) go a long way.
