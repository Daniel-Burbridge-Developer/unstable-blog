# How We Optimized MDX Performance

MDX is powerful, but it can introduce **performance bottlenecks**. Hereâ€™s what we did to speed things up:

## Key Optimizations

1. **Static Generation (SSG)** instead of dynamic rendering.
2. **Minimized plugin usage**â€”only `remark-gfm` and `remark-frontmatter`.
3. **Lazy-loaded heavy components** inside MDX.

## The Result?

Our blog loads **50% faster** and our Core Web Vitals are happier. ðŸŽ‰
