# Why Static Generation Wins for Blogs

When we debated **SSG vs. SSR** for our blog, we realized that **SSG wins** almost every time. Hereâ€™s why:

## The Pros of SSG

- **Blazing fast**: Pre-built pages load instantly.
- **Better SEO**: Fully indexed by search engines.
- **Lower server load**: No need to render on every request.

## When to Use SSR?

If you need **real-time updates** or **personalized content**, SSR makes sense. But for most blogs? **SSG is the way to go.**
