# Quest for unstable-blog: A Developer's RPG Journey

In the realm of software development, every project is an epic quest filled with challenges, unexpected plot twists, and moments of triumph that shape us as developers. My journey began with a bold vision—to create a blog app hosted at [blog.unstablevault.dev](https://blog.unstablevault.dev) that would not only serve as a platform for my musings but also as a battleground where I could hone my craft. With dreams of integrating a mighty CMS to remotely host blog posts, I soon found that the true adventure lay in scaling down the quest to manageable milestones, embracing a simpler yet powerful approach using NextJS and MDX.

## The Trials of Tailwind: Battling the Configuration Beast

Every hero’s journey is marked by its formidable foes, and mine came in the form of Tailwind configurations. The path was riddled with arcane puzzles and mysterious incantations that had me wrestling with the very fabric of my blog’s design. Armed with determination and the legendary Tailwind Prose plugin alongside its trusty sidekick, prose-invert, I embarked on a quest to bring clarity and style to my content. Countless hours were spent decoding cryptic errors and rewriting spells (or configurations) until, at last, the beast was tamed, and my blog posts shone with a reader-friendly glow that could rival any enchanted manuscript.

## The Misplaced Artifact: The MDX-Components Conundrum

No quest is without its missteps, and mine came when I unwittingly misplaced a vital artifact—the `mdx-components` file. Guided by the revered scrolls of the NextJS documentation, I was instructed to enshrine this file in the root directory of my project. However, in a twist worthy of any epic tale, I accidentally cast it into the mysterious depths of the `/app` folder. This misplacement led to a labyrinth of debugging sessions where each wrong turn felt like traversing a dungeon of frustration. Yet, like all great heroes, I learned from the setback, eventually reclaiming the artifact and restoring balance to my project’s structure.

## The Vercel Dragon: Confronting Deployment Dilemmas

As the final challenge loomed on the horizon, I turned my gaze towards the fearsome dragon known as Vercel. Intent on unleashing my creation upon the world, I deployed the blog only to be met with an error that emerged from the shadows—an anomaly tied to NextJS15. The error was a deceptive trick: while everything ran smoothly in the local realm with `pnpm run dev`, the production environment revealed that `params` was acting like a misbehaving Promise, a trait that Vercel’s gatekeepers did not anticipate. The battle was fierce and the error, persistent, demanding every ounce of my focus and courage.

## The Oracle’s Wisdom: ChatGPT to the Rescue

In the darkest hour of my quest, when hope seemed but a flicker in the vast expanse of code, I sought the wisdom of the ancient oracle—ChatGPT O3. With its guidance, I navigated the intricate web of deployment challenges and slowly unraveled the mystery behind the elusive error. The oracle’s insights were like a beacon in the night, illuminating the path to a solution that not only fixed the deployment issues but also imbued me with a deeper understanding of NextJS and modern web development. This encounter reminded me that every setback is an opportunity for learning, and every problem, once solved, makes the hero that much stronger.

## Epilogue: Reflections on the Journey

Looking back on this quest, the challenges—from battling the Tailwind configuration beast to confronting the Vercel dragon—have all contributed to an enriching and transformative journey. Each obstacle was a chapter in an evolving saga, where the trials not only tested my resolve but also expanded my skills and knowledge. As I continue to forge ahead with unstable-blog, I carry with me the lessons of perseverance, the thrill of discovery, and the unyielding spirit of a true adventurer.

May your own coding quests be filled with epic challenges and rewarding victories. Happy coding, brave traveler!
