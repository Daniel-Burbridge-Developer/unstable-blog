# Choosing the Right Blog Design

Designing a blog isn’t just about aesthetics—it’s about usability and performance. Here’s what we prioritized:

## 1. Readability First

- **Typography matters**: We chose a readable serif font for body text.
- **Dark mode support**: Essential for accessibility.

## 2. Navigation & Structure

- **Clear categories & tags**: Helps users find content quickly.
- **Sticky navbars**: Keeps important links accessible.

## 3. Performance Considerations

- **Minimal animations**: To avoid slowing things down.
- **Static images over client-side rendering**: Faster page loads.

Good design isn’t just pretty—it makes the blog experience better for everyone.
