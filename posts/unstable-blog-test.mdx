# Building unstable-blog: Adventures in MDX Magic

When we set out to build **unstable-blog**, we knew we wanted a platform that could handle both the raw simplicity of Markdown and the dynamic flexibility of JSX. Little did we know that the journey would be as wild and unpredictable as the name suggests!

## The Early Days: Wrestling with Webpack

Our first stop was understanding Webpack‚Äîyes, *that* Webpack. We spent more time than we care to admit poring over documentation and wondering, *"What is this sorcery?"* One thing became clear: using raw-loader was a no-go. Not only was it difficult to set up, but we quickly discovered that it could be downright unsafe.

## The Great Markdown Debate: next-mdx-remote vs. react-markdown

Choosing the right tool for handling Markdown content was another adventure in itself. We tested both **next-mdx-remote** and **react-markdown**. Here‚Äôs a quick snapshot of our findings:

### üî• **Comparison: `next-mdx-remote` vs. `react-markdown`**

| Feature                                 | `next-mdx-remote` üåü         | `react-markdown` üöÄ             |

| Supports MDX (JSX in Markdown)          | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚ùå No                           |
| Supports Static Generation (SSG)        | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚úÖ Yes                          |

| Custom components in Markdown           | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚úÖ Yes (via `components` prop)  |
| Requires front matter parsing           | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚úÖ Yes (manual parsing needed)  |
| Performance (lighter bundle)            | ‚úÖ Yes (static output)       | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly heavier             |
| Better for Blogs                        | ‚úÖ Yes                       | ‚úÖ Yes                          |

| Banana     | $0.5  |

**next-mdx-remote** won out for our project since we needed to embed React components inside our Markdown posts‚Äîsomething that plain Markdown simply can‚Äôt do.

## The Magic of MDX Components

One of the most surprising revelations was discovering the magic behind MDX. We learned that the infamous `mdx-components` file is a true game changer‚Äîbut only when placed correctly. After a few head-scratching moments (and a few too many cups of coffee), we realized that this file must live in the **ROOT** of the project. Not in the `app/` directory as we initially thought!

## A Quick Setup Checklist

While the journey was full of surprises, here‚Äôs a distilled checklist of what helped us along the way:

- [ ] **Install Dependencies:**  
  Run `pnpm add next-mdx-remote remark-gfm remark-frontmatter` to get your MDX tools ready.
- [ ] **Configure MDX on Next.js:**  
  Follow the [MDX configuration guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/mdx) to set up your project.
- [ ] **Place the Magic File:**  
  Remember‚Äîthe `mdx-components` file must reside in the **ROOT** of your project.
- [ ] **Tinker with Plugins:**  
  We tried different plugin configurations (and yes, sometimes the docs say one thing while reality says another). Persistence pays off!

## Unexpected Twists and Turns

Of course, not everything went according to plan. There were moments when:
- Our local development server restarted mysteriously in the middle of a build.
- We had intense debates over whether our bundle was ‚Äútoo heavy‚Äù or ‚Äújust right.‚Äù
- Late nights were spent debugging cryptic Webpack errors, all while humming our favorite tunes.

But each challenge taught us something new‚Äîabout MDX, about our tooling, and even about ourselves.

## Conclusion

Building **unstable-blog** was more than just a technical endeavor; it was an adventure full of learning, laughs, and a few ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moments along the way. If you're considering using MDX for your blog, prepare yourself for some quirky challenges‚Äîbut know that the flexibility and power you gain in return are well worth it.

Happy blogging, and may your MDX always be magical!
